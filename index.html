      <p>Hello, my name is Stephanie Dacullo and I am from Philippines. I love practicing martial arts during my free time because it helps me feel relaxed and empowered. It's a great way to release stress and tension, and it also gives me a sense of strength and confidence. In addition to martial arts, one of my favorite pastimes is playing with Rubik's Cube. Solving puzzles and using logic to figure out a solution is a great mental challenge that I enjoy. I also have an interest in technical stuff, even though it can be exhausting at times. Learning about new technology and how things work is fascinating to me, and I find it satisfying to apply that knowledge to solve problems or create something new. </p>
